						"She Shoulda Said No is a 1949 exploitation film in the spirit of morality tales such as the 1936 films Reefer Madness and Marihuana. Directed by Sam Newfield (listed as Sherman Scott) and starring Lila Leeds, it was inspired by the 1948 arrest of movie stars Robert Mitchum and Leeds for marijuana possession. The actors, along with two others, were arrested after smoking marijuana at Leeds home and were charged with the felony of narcotics possession. Public empathy for Mitchum resulted in his charge being downgraded, and his sentence of sixty days in jail was set aside in 1951. Leeds served sixty days in prison, and after her release found no work in Hollywood until she was cast in this film. The film was issued under many titles and struggled to find a distributor until film presenter Kroger Babb reissued it as The Story of Lila Leeds and Her ExposÃ© of the Marijuana Racket. It failed to achieve success under that title, and Babb eventually changed it to She Shoulda Said No! https://www.gogle.com yes",
